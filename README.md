# Digital-Attribution-Analysis-at-W.M.-Winters
In this online ad evaluation project, we aim to enhance marketing budget allocation using digital attribution. Leveraging a dataset encompassing 7,612 rows over one month, we compare first-touch and last-touch attribution models, analyze user activation behaviors for new and existing customers, and develop a linear attribution model. Our ultimate goal is to deliver a ROI-based evaluation, enabling data-driven decisions for optimizing marketing budget allocation across diverse channels, including display ads, search ads, and social media.
